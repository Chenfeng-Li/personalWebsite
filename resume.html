RESEARCH and PROJECT
Project Leader | Department of Statistics, UChicago Apr - May 2023
• Topic: Robustness to Spurious Correlations via Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO).
Reviewed the theory of DRO, built and evaluated a DRO neural network model, compiled reports.
• Led a team of three. Communicated with members and organized tasks.
• Constructed a colored MNIST dataset with spurious correlations, wrote a DRO models and applied to the
dataset. Made comparison with empirical risk minimization model. Concluded that the DRO model with strong regularization properly eliminates the influence of spurious correlations.
Statistical Consultant | Department of Statistics, UChicago Sep - Nov 2022 • Team of five. Provided consulting services to local clients with data issues.
• Reviewed the materials provided by clients in advance. Met with them online and discussed the detailed
concerning of their problem. Provided brief suggestions on data analysis.
• Delivered the final reports to clients. Made presentations to the instructor and other consulting groups. • Completed three consultations with healthcare firm and hospitals during the period.
Data Analyst | Chung Chi College, CUHK Jun - Dec 2021 • Capstone project. Topic: The current situation and feasible development direction of Chinese medicine.
• Teamwork of four. Explored public’s perception of Chinese medicine, the recent status of the profession
and the possible methods of its modernization.
• Google form to design a questionnaire about this perception,
Independent Researcher | Department of Mathematics, CUHK Sep - Dec 2020 • Topic: A General Review of Facial Recognition Technology.
• Reviewed the theories of several facial detection and recognition methods proposed in the past decades.
• Implemented a facial recognition model through Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on Python.
Achieved a prediction accuracy of 95% on a dataset with 2,749 images from 52 individuals.
